# Reports migration numbers this branch shares with a branch it will meet.
#
# Django numbers migrations sequentially from whatever it can see, and a worktree can only see itself.
# Two stories branching off the same leaf both get the next number, both stay green on their own, and
# the second one to merge turns "migrate" - and with it every database test - red on main.
#
# Usage: bash .claude/skills/implement-story/scripts/migration-numbers.sh [run_dir] [base-ref]
# Exit code: 0 when no number is shared with the base, 1 otherwise. A number shared with a neighbouring
# worktree is a warning rather than a failure: that branch may never land, and renumbering costs nothing.
